ðŸ‘‹ **Hi there, I'm Proser-V!**

Iâ€™m a student at Holberton School in Dijon (France), currently completing an intensive software engineering program.
Over the past 3 months, Iâ€™ve been diving deep into C programming, working on low-level system concepts like memory management, process handling, and compilation â€” and recently, I built my own simple UNIX shell from scratch in C.
As of today, Iâ€™m starting my journey with Python and excited to explore higher-level development!


ðŸ§  **What Iâ€™ve Learned So Far**

Languages:
C (advanced), Python (beginner), Shell scripting

Tools:
Git, GDB, Valgrind, Make, GCC

Key Concepts:
fork/execve/wait, memory allocation, pointers, compilation pipeline, file descriptors

Projects:
- Simple Shell: a fully functional command-line interpreter written in C, mimicking basic features of a UNIX shell
- Custom printf: a reimplementation of the standard C printf function
- Various data structure and algorithm exercises


ðŸ”Ž **What Iâ€™m Looking For**

I'm actively looking for an apprenticeship/internship opportunity, ideally in AI, AR-VR, or Full-stack development, or anything that challenges my technical growth.
I'm eager to:
- Work on real-world software projects
- Learn modern development practices
- Contribute to a team that values clean code and continuous learning


ðŸ“Œ **What You'll Find on My GitHub**

- Holberton School projects with clear structure and documentation
- My personal learning experiments (in C, Python, and beyond)
- For projects, clean and commented code that reflects my current level and progress
- Upcoming: more Python tools, scripts, and CLI applications


ðŸ§© **A Bit More About Me**

- I enjoy understanding how things work under the hood
- Iâ€™m detail-oriented and committed to writing readable, reliable code
- I believe in learning by doing, and Iâ€™m always open to feedback
- Iâ€™m also building up my English communication skills, so donâ€™t hesitate to reach out!
